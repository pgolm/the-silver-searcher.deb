 What's so great about Ag?
 .
 * It searches code about 3–5× faster than ack.
 * It ignores file patterns from your .gitignore and .hgignore.
 * If there are files in your source repo you don't want to search, just add their patterns to a .agignore file. *cough* extern *cough*
 * The command name is 33% shorter than ack!
